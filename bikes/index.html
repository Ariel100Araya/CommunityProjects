        <h3>Step 0: Find a bike 🚲</h3>
        <p>I didn't think I needed to write that one down... but yet here we are</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 1: Select the price. 💸</h3>
        <p>Find a price that is affordable but can still give you a profit</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 2: Put Bike on front yard. 🏠</h3>
        <p>Make sure people passing by can see it. if not what is the point of selling it in the first place</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 3: Wait for people to come by and see it 👀</h3>
        <p>Let people know its up for offer but also guard it so that it doesn't get stolen</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 4:If someone comes up to you, discuss pricing 🗣</h3>
        <h4>If agreed on price, trade pieces of paper with value with a glorified metal tube.</h4>
        <h4>If both parties cant agree on a price, say no and go back to step 3.</h4>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 5: Party 🎉</h3>
        <p>Congrats you just sold a bike<p>
